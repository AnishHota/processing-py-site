###Things that still need to be done:

    - Edit htmlgenerator.py so that every .html file has a comment that says "This page was generated by a script htmlgenerator.py located in ...". 

    - Write a script to generate an index page from the xml files. 

    - Edit htmlgenerator.py to create links between related pages.  
    
    - Ensure that all xml files are only relevant to P5.py (i.e. there aren't files from Java mode left over from the translation). 

    - The directory structure doesn't make all that much sense right now. Currently, generated html files are output to Reference/api_en/hmlconversions. Ideally, they would be placed directly in Referenc.

    - Apply .css styling to .html pages, based on the main Processing site. I believe we decided to use the color scheme and font from Python.org.

###Incomplete xml files as of this writing (mostly specific to Python):
   
string.xml
string_slice.xml
list_slice.xml
list.xml
[and any others that would be useful for a Python novice]
