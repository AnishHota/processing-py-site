# Processing Py Site

Repository for py.processing.org.

Install requirements:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
To build all content:
    ./generator.py build --all
To test the site in a local server
    ./generator.py test
To see what else you can do:
    ./generator.py --help

###Things that still need to be done:

- Edit htmlgenerator.py so that every .html file has a comment that says something like: "This page was generated by a script htmlgenerator.py located in ...". 

- Write a script to generate an index page from the xml files (see existing Processing reference). 

- Edit htmlgenerator.py to create links between related pages.  

- Ensure that all xml files are only relevant to P5.py (i.e. there aren't files that only pertain to Java mode left over from the translation). 

- The directory structure of the site doesn't make sense right now. Currently, generated html files are output to Reference/api_en/hmlconversions. Ideally, they would be placed directly in Reference.

- Apply .css styling to .html pages, based on the main Processing site. Golan proposed using the color scheme and typeface from Python.org (SourceSansProRegular and Flux-Regular).

###Incomplete xml files as of this writing (mostly specific to Python):
   
- string.xml
- string_slice.xml
- list_slice.xml
- list.xml
- [and any others that would be useful for a Python novice]
