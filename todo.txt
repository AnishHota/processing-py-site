Things that still need to be done:

    - Edit htmlgenerator.py so that every .html file has a comment that says "This page was generated by a script htmlgenerator.py located in ...". 

    - Write a script to generate an index page from the xml files. 

    - Edit htmlgenerator.py to create links between related pages.  
    
    - Ensure that all xml files are only relevant to P5.py (i.e. there aren't files from Java mode left over from the translation). 

Incomplete xml files as of this writing (mostly specific to Python):
   
string.xml
string_slice.xml
list_slice.xml
list.xml
[and any others that would be useful for a Python novice]
