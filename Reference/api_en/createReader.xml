<description><![CDATA[
Creates a BufferedReader object that can be used to read files line-by-line as individual String objects. This is the complement to the createWriter() function. 

Starting with Processing release 0134, all files loaded and saved by the Processing API use UTF-8 encoding. In previous releases, the default encoding for your platform was used, which causes problems when files are moved to other platforms.
