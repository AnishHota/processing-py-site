<code><![CDATA[
# Create a file in the sketch directory
output = createWriter("positions.txt")
numbers = [17, 34, 190, 4, 18, 12]
for item in numbers:
    output.println(item) # Write the datum to the file
output.flush()# Writes the remaining data to the file
output.close()# Finishes the file
exit()# Stops the program

<description><![CDATA[
Creates a new file in the sketch folder, and a <b>PrintWriter</b> object to write to it. For the file to be made correctly, it should be flushed and must be closed with its <b>flush()</b> and <b>close()</b> methods (see above example).

Starting with Processing release 0134, all files loaded and saved by the Processing API use UTF-8 encoding. In previous releases, the default encoding for your platform was used, which causes problems when files are moved to other platforms.
